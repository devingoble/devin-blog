      <p>Hi there!</p>
      <br />
      <p>I'm a full stack developer, primarily focused on the .NET ecosystem. I work in .NET Framework and .NET Core. Along the way, I've built up expertise in Windows, SQL Server and Azure. Working with .NET Core has given me opportunity to branch out into web applications that run in Linux containers in a Docker environment.</p>
      <br />
      <p>This blog is a chance to write about some of the things that I learn along the way.</p>
