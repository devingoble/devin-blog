For a long time I've wanted to record some of my thoughts on a variety of topics. Sometimes I'll search high and low for an answer, only to end up at a purple link, but no memory of ever having been there before. My goal is to try to capture those moments here.

Right now, I'm aiming for a couple of posts a month. I have no idea how that'll go ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Primary topics will probably be related to the .NET stack. Although, as I fool around with other technologies, they may creep in as well.

Somewhere along the way, if I can help somebody else out, that'll be a wonderful bonus.

Welcome.
