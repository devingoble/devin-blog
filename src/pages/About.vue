      <br />
      <p>I'm a developer, primarily focused on the .NET ecosystem. I work in .NET Framework and .NET Core. Along the way, I've built up expertise in Windows, SQL Server and Azure. Working with .NET Core has pulled me a back into Linux a little after a long absence. I'm also trying to pick up some Vue and React.</p>
      <br />
      <p>As much as I enjoy the technology world, it's important to get outside once in a while. I like doing things outside and building things with my hands.</p>
      <br />
      <p>This blog is a chance to write about some of the things that I learn along the way.</p>
